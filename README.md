## Usage

First of all add the plugin to the plugins folder and then follow the necessary steps to configure it properly.

## How does the plugin work?

When you use the /setwarp command, a warp is created in the "warps.yml" file with the coordinates and the current world. Then a command is generated for that warp and it becomes executable. When a player executes this command, he is teleported to the position specified by the warp.

## Future updates
1. ∆ Set individual permissions for each command, specifying who can use them.
   
2. ■ Create a description for each command, explaining its functionality.
   
3. ■ Create a command to delete warps, allowing players to remove warp points.
   
4. ■ Create a command to update warps, allowing players to modify existing teleport points.

5. ■ Create a command to see the created warps.
